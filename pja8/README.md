##PJA (Pure Java AWT) para JDK8

PJA Toolkit (http://www.eteks.com/pja/en/) is a project that has been discontinued in 2004 and original sources doesn't compile with JDK8 since it's using JDK internal API that has been changed a lot through the years.

The original source has been adjusted a bit to be able to compile with Java 8 or above.

To build the library just run `./gradlew clean build`

The generated artifact can be found in `build/libs/pja8-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
